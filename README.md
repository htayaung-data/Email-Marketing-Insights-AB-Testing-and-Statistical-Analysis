# Email Marketing A/B Testing Project

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive analysis of email marketing strategies for ABC eCommerce, a leading online retailer. The primary goal is to optimize email marketing campaigns by conducting A/B tests to evaluate the effectiveness of different email subject lines, promotional content, and the impact of previous customer engagement on revenue.

## Project Objectives

1. **Subject Line Impact on Open Rates**: Determine whether 'Gender Highlighted' or 'Product Highlighted' subject lines lead to higher open rates.
2. **Promotional Content Influence on Conversion Rates**: Assess which type of promotional content ('Limited Time Discount', 'Present Offer Promotion', 'Lucky Draw Promotion') is most effective in driving conversions.
3. **Previous Engagement Scores and Revenue**: Analyze the correlation between previous engagement scores and revenue generated from emails.

## Methodology

- **Data Collection**: Utilized a dataset of 25,000 emails, stratified by key demographics to ensure balanced representation.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Employed Chi-Square tests, Logistic Regression, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and Poisson Regression to evaluate hypotheses.
- **Data Visualization**: Used Matplotlib and Seaborn for visual insights into customer segments, revenue distribution, and engagement metrics.

## Key Findings

1. **Subject Line Effectiveness**: 'Gender Highlighted' subjects significantly increase open rates.
2. **Promotional Content Success**: 'Present Offer Promotion' content leads to higher conversion rates.
3. **Engagement and Revenue**: Higher previous engagement scores are positively correlated with increased revenue.

## Recommendations

- **Subject Lines**: Focus on 'Gender Highlighted' subjects to boost open rates.
